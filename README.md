## Hi! I'm Jefandra Ayu Qoirunnissa

I'm an undergraduate student of multimedia from Indonesia. Currently, I'm learning a lot of things such as web and mobile app development, game programming, UI/UX, audio production, 2D animation, digital marketing, etc. My main interests are art and design, so I aspire to be a great illustrator and graphic designer.
